                My country’s name is Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a very small country huge population. It is a medium-developed country in South Asia. We <br />have a very good and progressing economy. It has an area of 147,570 square kilometers. But it has a population of 164 million. That is huge <br />than the area. <br />
                <br />

                But it is still a very beautiful and peaceful country. People of Bangladesh are so friendly with each other. This country has a glorious history <br /> of independence. We got independence from Pakistan in 1971 after nine mothers’ blood-shedding war. More than 3 million Bangladeshi <br /> sacrificed their life in that genocide. <br />
                <br />

                But still, we were able to get our independence. After independence, the newly born country faced lots of hard times and struggles. But it <br /> rises very well. Now Bangladesh is one of the best countries to live in South Asia. There are so many beautiful spots to see in this country.
